				<h3>Investigating Design Strategies for Augmented Reality based Learning Experience in Classrooms</h3>
				<p>Ongoing Doctoral Thesis, IIT Bombay, July 2017 - Present</p>
				
						<p>The use of ICT mediums is prevalent in Indian schools nowadays. However, they still involve instructor-mediated instructions using technological tools. After showing related examples or demonstrations to students using technology mediums, the students are given textbook problems to solve, making it difficult for students to think and solve the problems beyond the ones given in the textbook. There are various abstract concepts that need visualisation. In the process of teaching such concepts, it cannot be assured whether the students have learned those concepts. Moreover, the evaluation of students’ learning is done using formative tests after a chapter gets over. The current system lacks in providing the students with immediate feedback to validate whether the student has been able to learn the taught concept. Thus, the thesis focuses in designing a student-centred classroom solution using one of the emerging technologies called Augmented Reality (AR) to provide interactive and immersive learning experience to students. The research work is focused at answering questions such as what must be the design considerations in designing such an experience? What components must be considered for providing a good user experience while using an interactive visualisation aiding tool in the classroom? How to assure instant evaluation of the learned concepts using the designed interactive visualisation tool? What framework must be followed by the designers to design such a classroom-based interactive teacher- student learning tool? Based on the generated framework, we are designing an AR application to validate the framework and understand the students learning impact, usability, interactivity and perceived usefulness. </p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8">

						<p class="text-right" style="float: right">Most of the existing unutilised equipment in Indian schools, like projectors and computers are low-end and obsolete in today’s technology context. Moreover, these existing devices are not portable, not interactive and not collaborative. The solution we propose would be reusable in terms of hardware by multiple standards within the same school, and customisable/reusable in terms of software across multiple devices. This allows for collaborative learning as well as access to study content beyond the scope of the school premises. To bring in the simplicity in the use of technology, Augmented Reality (AR) based learning aids can be introduced to the students. We are designing an AR application for Mathematics and Science as per the syllabus of Maharashtra board with small activities to test the learning abilities using AR for the students of class 5 to 8. Hence, AR can be helpful for students in having shared learning experience through spatial visualisation and interactive collaboration. The project is focusing on these qualities of AR to enhance the learning experience of the rural students (which could be further customised or scaled for schools, in general).</p>

						<p>It is quite challenging for school students to understand the concepts of three-dimensional objects as it requires the ability of spatial visualisation. Mental Rotation being a type of spatial ability requires one to do actions mentally such as twisting, rotating or inverting a 3D object. Studies have reported that developing mental rotation ability leads to developing the mathematical problem solving skills in individuals. However, with the traditional method of teaching i.e. by showing the physical objects, a 2D representation of the 3D objects, or through paper nets, it becomes difficult/tedious for the students to visualise mentally and do the rotation. The Web-based software used currently, also pose the restriction of proper interaction and manipulation of objects on the computer screens. Thus, to address these gaps, we have designed an Augmented Reality (AR) based application - GeoSolvAR. We presented GeoSolvAR with learning activities built on the theoretical foundations of Predict-Observe- Explain (POE) strategy, which enables learners to enhance their mental rotation ability. The broad goals of our study were to test the effectiveness of GeoSolvAR and redesigning of GeoSolvAR. The impact of GeoSolvAR on learners’ mental rotation ability, the interaction path followed by learners to do mental rotation and user experience of learners using GeoSolvAR were observed.</p>

				<hp>IIT Bombay, August 2017 | Team: 3</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8">

						<p class="text-right" style="float: right">In this project, we designed an educational board game named ‘FACTREE’, for children of age 8+ years to help them learn and practice Factors taught in Mathematics. To start the game, each player picks up 10 tiles from the bag without looking inside the bag. These numbered tiles are the factors of the numbers written on the board. The game is to be played in turns. In each turn, the player places one or more tile(s) of factor(s) of any number on the board within 30 seconds. The player must NOT keep the tile of 1 and the number itself as the factor on the board. While keeping the tile on the board, the player needs to necessarily tell how that factor is formed. Any other player can shout “Factree” if the player forgets to tell the reason in his/her chance. Thus, the game was based on enhancing mental capabilities of children to calculate factors of numbers till 50.</p>

						<p>In many schools in India, K-12 education system is followed where children study from Kindergarten till class 12. In the private sectors, better facilities, resources and infrastructure lead to more percentage of student enrolment. These schools are also adopting technological platforms to provide knowledge to students. However, the students are gradually losing interest in what is being taught to them as they are unable to understand what is being taught in the class. Students usually find it difficult to visualise what is being told by the teacher. Even if they visualise it, they are unsure of them visualising in the right direction. Therefore, in order to pass the examination, rather than understanding the content, they end up in rote learning. Various digital platforms are being introduced in the Indian Education context to make it an interesting learning experience. In this research study, an attempt has been made to introduce the technology of Augmented Reality in Indian education with the case study on Class X Geography subject. With the related data being shown in 3D format, it helps the students to visually register the data as well understand it well. The students are also required to be motivated throughout the learning process. For this short quiz games have been introduced to test their grasped knowledge. Thus, this research provides an interactive and engaging experience for the students to make the subject of Geography interesting for them.</p>

				<hp>IIT Kanpur, Oct 2016 | Team: 2</p>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-9">

						<p class="text-right" style="float: right">Every year a high number of road accidents are recorded in Indian metro cities. Through two iterations of literature study, interviews and insights, we found that wrongful driving practices, especially over- speeding, is majorly done by the youth of age group 15 to 30 years. The main reason derived is ‘in hurry’, be it on less familiar or over- familiar routes/areas. To motivate these people to follow traffic rules and drive safely, we propose the design of a ‘persuasive’ mobile application. The application predicts the traffic on the possible routes to your destination, based on previous analysis. It provides live traffic status along with real-time notification of road signs appearing on the road. The user can share the route traffic status with others to kill the fear of facing consequences of getting late. A person can also share his/her experience of route traffic to guide others. Each of such actions fetches the user points which further gives monetary incentives. Our goal is thus, to motivate people through gamification, by providing points for rightful driving practices. This is done to bring gradual behavioural change of not breaking traffic rules under any pressure. We try to persuade people to drive better and stay safe on roads.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">

						<p class="text-right" style="float: right">The biggest challenge that comes in the utility of an inhaler is that small kids start to cry when they are asked to use the inhaler. This results in choking their epiglottis due to which the aerosol cannot reach the lungs. In this project, two playful inhalers for kids were designed. Our products were designed in a way to solve this problem of utility and become more effective.</p><p>In the first prototype, during the inhalation process the air enters and exits the case in such a way that the thermocol confetti balls start to juggle while making a rustling sound. This grabs the attention of the kids and distracts them so that they don’t start to cry and stay engaged with the playful elements. This enhances the experience of the medication process and makes it less troublesome.</p><p>In the second prototype, on inhaling through the spacer the user can see the light glowing. Kids often hesitate to use the spacers as they feel uncomfortable to place such a bulky object on their mouths and thus start to cry. The glowing of the light can act as a source of entertainment and
motivation for them. This also acts as an indicator and turns out to be very useful for the parents in knowing if their kid is really inhaling or not.</p>

The objective is to collaborate with the other player and swap the black and white tiles on the board to obtain the chosen pattern. The game pack contains a board with pockets, square tiles of black and white colour to be placed in the pockets and a dice with the pictures of three animals, one on two faces. Two players of age 6 and above collaborate to swap the black and white tiles on the board to obtain the pattern chosen from the instruction manual. Multiple patterns have been given in the instruction manual, that can be formed by rearranging the black and white tiles. However, one player moves the white tile and other player moves the black tile as per the move of the animal that comes on throwing the dice. The movement of the three animals - Camel, Horse and Elephant is similar to the movement defined in Chess. The patterns are classified as Easy, Medium, Hard and Guru, based on the difficulty level of forming the patterns. Nobody loses in this game. Both the players help each other and win by completing the chosen pattern.</p>
